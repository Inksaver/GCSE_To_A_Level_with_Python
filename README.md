# GCSE To A Level with Python
Some thoughts for GCSE CS students moving to A Level (UK)
Python seems to be the language of choice for most UK secondary schools, especially at GCSE level.
This is often continued into A level as students already have a good knowledge of Python.
As the exams are biased to roughly 20% code to 80% theory, the time spent learning code is limited, and as a result the code produced by most students could be improved.
This repo is a source of ideas from a C# programmer's experience to improve code typically seen at GCSE to a standard more suitable for A level.

Some lua code is used initially for examples which is taken from the resource at https://github.com/Inksaver/LuaForSchools
